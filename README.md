Overview

This project is a Pedigree Application (Family Tree App) that runs directly in the browser. It is designed to visualize family trees with medical genetics notation, making it especially useful for genetic counseling, teaching, or research.

Core Features

Interactive Graphical Interface
Users can add and remove family members, partners, and children. Relationships are automatically drawn with clear vertical and horizontal connectors.

Standard Genetic Symbols

□ Male

○ Female

■/● Affected individual (cancer or other disease)

◐/◑ Obligate carrier (must be a carrier due to family history)

“+” Mutation carrier (positive genetic test)

“–” Wild-type (negative test result)

Cascade Deletion
When a parent or marriage node is removed, if there is only one child, that child and all of their descendants are also removed, preventing “orphan” branches.

Multiple Marriages
If a person has more than one partner, each marriage generates a new, independent subtree, ensuring correct visualization of complex family structures.

Mandatory Information for New Members
When adding a new person, both name and sex are required. This enforces data consistency across the pedigree.

Dynamic Member List
A sidebar lists all individuals in the pedigree. Clicking a name in the list highlights and selects that person in the tree for quick navigation.

Export Options
The pedigree can be exported as PDF or PNG, allowing users to share or print results easily.

Local Storage Support
The application saves data in the browser, so users can return later and continue where they left off.

Use Cases

Medical Genetics: Documenting hereditary conditions such as Lynch syndrome or BRCA-related cancers.

Education: Teaching students about inheritance patterns.

Family Research: Creating visually accurate family trees with medical details.
